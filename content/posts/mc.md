### Background

During the Chinese New Year holiday, I spent some time at home playing on the Switch with my child, and I ended up purchasing Minecraft (Bedrock Edition). In order to play together, I also bought the Windows version. Additionally, I wanted to test if the GitHub Actions for this blog are still working properly.

### Preparation

You need two Microsoft accounts, so I dug out my wife's long-unused Hotmail account.

### Multiplayer

1. Restart the game on the Switch and log into the Microsoft account. It has to be restarted each time, and I'm not sure why.
1. Add each other as friends using the short ID.
1. Create a world on the Switch; Windows should join (it doesn't work the other way around, and I'm not sure why).
1. Enjoy playing together!

This guide is brief and straightforward, with nothing much more to add.
