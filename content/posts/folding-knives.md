Recently, I decided to expand my collection of folding knives and purchased three models from **[Sanrenmu](#)**. For anyone considering a new knife or looking for suggestions, I wanted to share my experiences with these three models: the 9201, 9008, and 820. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and hopefully, my insights can help you make an informed decision.

## Sanrenmu 9201

- **Price:** 198 Yuan
- **Lock Type:** Axis Lock
- **Handle Material:** Plastic
- **Blade Material:** D2 Steel

### First Impressions

The 9201 features an axis lock mechanism, which I found to be **very smooth and easy to open and close**. The D2 steel blade offers good edge retention, and the plastic handle keeps the knife lightweight.

### Pros

- **Ease of Use:** The axis lock allows for ambidextrous operation, making it convenient for both left and right-handed users.
- **Lightweight:** The plastic handle reduces overall weight, making it comfortable to carry.

### Cons

- **Poor Detailing:** Some edges and surfaces were rough, causing minor cuts to my hand during use.
- **Finish Quality:** The attention to detail was lacking, which detracted from the overall experience.

### Personal Modifications

I used sandpaper and a rotary tool to smooth out the rough edges. While this improved the handling, I accidentally scratched the blade slightly during the process.

## Sanrenmu 9008

- **Price:** 168 Yuan
- **Lock Type:** Frame Lock with Safety Lock
- **Handle Material:** Steel
- **Blade Material:** Unknown
- **Features:** Quick-opening flipper

### First Impressions

Out of the box, the 9008 showcased **excellent workmanship**. The quick-opening flipper worked flawlessly, and the safety lock adds an extra layer of security when the knife is not in use.

### Pros

- **Build Quality:** The knife feels solid and well-constructed.
- **Quick-opening Flipper:** Provides rapid deployment of the blade.
- **Safety Lock:** Prevents accidental opening.

### Cons

- **Weight:** The steel handle makes it quite heavy, which isn't ideal for everyday carry.
- **Button Quality:** The button mechanism isn't as smooth as I would like.
- **Blade Material:** Unspecified steel that doesn't hold an edge as well as higher-end materials.

### Usage

Due to its weight, I decided to **keep the 9008 in my car**. It features a window-breaking hammer, making it a practical tool for emergencies.

## Sanrenmu 820

- **Price:** 298 Yuan
- **Lock Type:** Frame Lock
- **Handle Material:** Titanium
- **Blade Material:** VG10 Steel
- **Features:** Ball bearings (no safety lock or flipper)

### First Impressions

The 820 stands out with its **titanium handle and VG10 blade**, offering a premium feel. It operates on ball bearings, ensuring a smooth action when opening and closing.

### Pros

- **Material Quality:** The VG10 blade and titanium handle are high-quality materials that enhance durability and aesthetics.
- **Workmanship:** Excellent fit and finish.

### Cons

1. **Opening Mechanism Issues:**

   - The stop pin is too small.
   - The lock interface is large and deep, making one-handed opening difficult.

2. **Pocket Clip:**

   - The clip is excessively tight, making it hard to attach to pockets easily.

### Personal Modifications

I disassembled the 820 and **polished the lock interface**, significantly improving the ease of one-handed opening. Post-modification, the knife opens smoothly, though there's a slight looseness when closed.

## Reflections and Insights

- **Axis Lock vs. Frame Lock:**

  - *Axis Lock (9201):* Offers ambidextrous use and works well with a plastic handle but has a complex structure that's challenging to disassemble.
  - *Frame Lock (820 & 9008):* Simpler design and easier to disassemble (especially the 820 after some practice). However, it's more suited to one-handed use and relies heavily on precise craftsmanship for smooth operation.

- **Handle Materials:**

  - *Titanium Handle (820):* Initially underestimated, the titanium handle provides a superior feel compared to plastic or steel. Once accustomed to it, switching back to other materials feels like a downgrade.
  - *Steel Handle (9008):* Durable but adds unnecessary weight, making it less ideal for carrying around.
  - *Plastic Handle (9201):* Lightweight but doesn't offer the same premium feel as metal handles.

- **Practicality vs. Aesthetics:**

  - The 9008, while heavy, serves a practical purpose in the car for emergencies.
  - The 820, after modifications, has become my preferred **everyday carry** despite the tight pocket clip.

- **DIY Modifications:**

  - Personalizing and improving the knives was a rewarding experience, even if there were minor mishaps like scratching the blade on the 9201.
  - Disassembling and reassembling the 820 has turned it into not just a tool but a hobbyist's toy.

## Conclusion

Each knife has its place:

- **Sanrenmu 9008:** Stays in the car for emergency situations, thanks to its sturdy build and window-breaking feature.
- **Sanrenmu 820:** Becomes my go-to carry knife after modifications. Its high-quality materials and improved functionality make it stand out.
- **Sanrenmu 9201:** Although I'm unsure of its future use, it might serve as an additional car knife or a backup.

If you're considering a Sanrenmu folding knife, think about what features matter most to youâ€”be it the locking mechanism, handle material, or ease of carry. Also, don't shy away from making personal adjustments to tailor the knife to your preferences.
