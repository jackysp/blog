Recently, I decided to expand my collection of folding knives and purchased three models from **[Sanrenmu](#)**. For anyone considering a new knife or looking for suggestions, I wanted to share my experiences with these three models: the 9201, 9008, and 820. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and hopefully, my insights can help you make an informed decision.

## Sanrenmu 9201

- **Price:** 198 Yuan
- **Lock Type:** Axis Lock
- **Handle Material:** Plastic
- **Blade Material:** D2 Steel

### First Impressions

The 9201 features an axis lock mechanism, which I found to be **very smooth and easy to open and close**. The D2 steel blade offers good edge retention, and the plastic handle keeps the knife lightweight.

### Pros

- **Ease of Use:** The axis lock allows for ambidextrous operation, making it convenient for both left and right-handed users.
- **Lightweight:** The plastic handle reduces overall weight, making it comfortable to carry.

### Cons

- **Poor Detailing:** Some edges and surfaces were rough, causing minor cuts to my hand during use.
- **Finish Quality:** The attention to detail was lacking, which detracted from the overall experience.

### Personal Modifications

I used sandpaper and a rotary tool to smooth out the rough edges. While this improved the handling, I accidentally scratched the blade slightly during the process.

## Sanrenmu 9008

- **Price:** 168 Yuan
- **Lock Type:** Frame Lock with Safety Lock
- **Handle Material:** Steel
- **Blade Material:** Unknown
- **Features:** Quick-opening flipper

### First Impressions

Out of the box, the 9008 showcased **excellent workmanship**. The quick-opening flipper worked flawlessly, and the safety lock adds an extra layer of security when the knife is not in use.

### Pros

- **Build Quality:** The knife feels solid and well-constructed.
- **Quick-opening Flipper:** Provides rapid deployment of the blade.
- **Safety Lock:** Prevents accidental opening.

### Cons

- **Weight:** The steel handle makes it quite heavy, which isn't ideal for everyday carry.
- **Button Quality:** The button mechanism isn't as smooth as I would like.
- **Blade Material:** Unspecified steel that doesn't hold an edge as well as higher-end materials.

### Usage

Due to its weight, I decided to **keep the 9008 in my car**. It features a window-breaking hammer, making it a practical tool for emergencies.

## Sanrenmu 820

- **Price:** 298 Yuan
- **Lock Type:** Frame Lock
- **Handle Material:** Titanium
- **Blade Material:** VG10 Steel
- **Features:** Ball bearings (no safety lock or flipper)

### First Impressions

The 820 stands out with its **titanium handle and VG10 blade**, offering a premium feel. It operates on ball bearings, ensuring a smooth action when opening and closing.

### Pros

- **Material Quality:** The VG10 blade and titanium handle are high-quality materials that enhance durability and aesthetics.
- **Workmanship:** Excellent fit and finish.

### Cons

1. **Opening Mechanism Issues:**

   - The stop pin is too small.
   - The lock interface is large and deep, making one-handed opening difficult.

2. **Pocket Clip:**

   - The clip is excessively tight, making it hard to attach to pockets easily.

### Personal Modifications

I disassembled the 820 and **polished the lock interface**, significantly improving the ease of one-handed opening. Post-modification, the knife opens smoothly, though there's a slight looseness when closed.

## Reflections and Insights

- **Axis Lock vs. Frame Lock:**

  - *Axis Lock (9201):* Offers ambidextrous use and works well with a plastic handle but has a complex structure that's challenging to disassemble.
  - *Frame Lock (820 & 9008):* Simpler design and easier to disassemble (especially the 820 after some practice). However, it's more suited to one-handed use and relies heavily on precise craftsmanship for smooth operation.

- **Handle Materials:**

  - *Titanium Handle (820):* Initially underestimated, the titanium handle provides a superior feel compared to plastic or steel. Once accustomed to it, switching back to other materials feels like a downgrade.
  - *Steel Handle (9008):* Durable but adds unnecessary weight, making it less ideal for carrying around.
  - *Plastic Handle (9201):* Lightweight but doesn't offer the same premium feel as metal handles.

- **Practicality vs. Aesthetics:**

  - The 9008, while heavy, serves a practical purpose in the car for emergencies.
  - The 820, after modifications, has become my preferred **everyday carry** despite the tight pocket clip.

- **DIY Modifications:**

  - Personalizing and improving the knives was a rewarding experience, even if there were minor mishaps like scratching the blade on the 9201.
  - Disassembling and reassembling the 820 has turned it into not just a tool but a hobbyist's toy.

## Conclusion

Each knife has its place:

- **Sanrenmu 9008:** Stays in the car for emergency situations, thanks to its sturdy build and window-breaking feature.
- **Sanrenmu 820:** Becomes my go-to carry knife after modifications. Its high-quality materials and improved functionality make it stand out.
- **Sanrenmu 9201:** Although I'm unsure of its future use, it might serve as an additional car knife or a backup.

If you're considering a Sanrenmu folding knife, think about what features matter most to you—be it the locking mechanism, handle material, or ease of carry. Also, don't shy away from making personal adjustments to tailor the knife to your preferences.
