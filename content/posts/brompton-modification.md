I'm excited to share the final version of my **Aceoffix 01**, a Brompton clone bike I've been customizing:

## What Modifications Did I Make?

1. **Handlebar Grips**

   The original grips were glued on and became loose over time, so I replaced them with new, more secure ones.

2. **Bell**

   Safety first! I added a bell to alert pedestrians and other cyclists.

3. **CNC Mount Base for Action Cameras**

   Installed at the center of the handlebar, it's perfect for mounting my DJI OSMO Pocket 1 or a phone holder.

4. **Front Bottle Bag from Decathlon Riverside**

   A convenient spot for a water bottle and small items.

5. **Front Light**

   Mounted just above the front wheel to illuminate the path without blinding anyone.

6. **Soft Saddle from Decathlon**

   For a more comfortable ride.

7. **Four Universal Easy Wheels**

   These make the bike easier to push when folded. The set of four cost me 100 SGD.

8. **Taillight**

   For visibility and safety during night rides.

9. **Front Bag**

   Provides additional storage space for essentials.

10. **Anti-Loose Accessory**

    Helps keep components tight and secure.

11. **Tool Set**

    Essential for on-the-go repairs and adjustments.

## Why Did I Choose These Modifications?

I experimented with mounting accessories on the handlebar, like the bottle holder and front light, but it made the handlebar too crowded and unstable. For instance, the bottle holder wasn't secure when attached to the handlebar. I decided to utilize existing mounts, such as the taillight bracket, to streamline the setup.

The additional accessories are intended to make the bike even easier to push when folded. It's already convenient, but I thought, *why not enhance it further?*

## Areas for Improvement

- **Anti-Loose Accessory**: It's not working as well as I'd hoped and might need to be replaced.

- **Front Bag Straps**: They're a bit long, and I'm concerned they could get caught in the front wheel. I might need to shorten them.

## Cost Breakdown

Most accessories cost between **5–50 SGD**, except for the universal wheels, which were **100 SGD** for all four. Initially, I wasn't sure if I needed all four wheels—maybe two would have sufficed—but I ultimately decided to get all four for better stability.

## Anything Else?

I can't think of anything else at the moment. If you have any suggestions or feedback, I'd love to hear them!

## Tips for Buying Accessories in Singapore

- **Decathlon**: A great place to find affordable accessories, and they have a 365-day return policy!

- **Shopee**: Good for finding unique or hard-to-find items.

- **Taobao**: Offers a wide range of accessories, but shipping can be expensive. You can ask a friend in China to help you buy and ship the items to Singapore.

I don't recommend buying from bike shops in Singapore, as they tend to be more expensive—about twice the price.
