This is the final version of my **Aceoffix 01** (a Brompton clone).

## What Did I Change on It?

1. **Bicycle Handlebar Grips**
   The default ones were glued on and became loose, so I replaced them with new grips.
2. **A Bell**
   Safety first! I added a bell to alert pedestrians and other cyclists.
3. **CNC Mount Base for Action Cameras**
   Installed at the center of the handlebar, it's perfect for my DJI OSMO Pocket 1 or a phone mount.
4. **Front Bottle Bag from Decathlon Riverside**
   Convenient for storing a water bottle and small items.
5. **Front Light**
   Positioned just above the front wheel to illuminate the path without blinding pedestrians.
6. **Soft Saddle from Decathlon**
   For a more comfortable ride.
7. **Four Universal Easy Wheels**
   These make the bike easier to push when folded. Cost: 100 SGD for all four.
8. **Taillight**
   For visibility and safety during night rides.
9. **Front Bag**
   Additional storage space for essentials.
10. **Anti-Loose Accessory**
    Helps to keep components tight and secure.

11. **Set of Tools**
    Essential for on-the-go repairs and adjustments.

## Why Did I Choose These Modifications?

I've experimented with mounting accessories on the handlebar, like the bottle holder and front light, but it made the handlebar too crowded and unstable. For example, the bottle holder wasn't stable on the handlebar. I wanted to utilize existing mounts, such as the taillight bracket, to streamline the setup.

The other accessories aim to make the bike even easier to push when folded. It's already convenient, but I thought, *why not enhance it further?*

## Areas for Improvement

- **Anti-Loose Accessory**: It's not working as well as I'd hoped and might need to be replaced.
- **Front Bag Straps**: They're a bit long, and I worry they could get caught in the front wheel. Shortening them might be necessary.

## Cost Breakdown

All accessories cost between **5–50 SGD**, except for the universal wheels, which were **100 SGD** for all four. I was initially unsure about purchasing four wheels—maybe two would have sufficed—but I ultimately decided to get all four.

## Anything Else?

I can't think of more at the moment. If you have any suggestions or feedback, I'd love to hear them!

## Tips for buying accessories in Singapore

- **Decathlon**: A great place to find affordable accessories. And it has a 365-day return policy!
- **Shopee**: Good for finding unique or hard-to-find items.
- **Taobao**: Offers a wide range of accessories, but shipping can be expensive. You can ask a friend in China to help you buy and ship the items to Singapore.

Not to suggest buying from a bike shop in Singapore, as they tend to be more expensive, about 2x the price.
