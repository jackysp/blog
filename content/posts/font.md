## Background

The English font set in Microsoft's VS Code is monospaced, while the Chinese font is not.

## Method

1. Download and install the fonts from [here](https://github.com/be5invis/Sarasa-Gothic). This font combines Source Han Sans and is said to align punctuation strictly.
2. Use the method described [here](https://github.com/be5invis/Sarasa-Gothic/issues/8) to set up VS Code.

PS: It is indeed aligned, although the English text appears a bit narrow.
