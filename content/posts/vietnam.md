Vietnam is a vibrant country with a rich culture, friendly people, and stunning landscapes. Recently, I spent some time exploring Vietnam, and I wanted to share some of my experiences and tips to help fellow travelers make the most of their visit.

## Internet Access and Blocked Websites

- **Slow Access to Twitter**: If you're an avid Twitter user, be prepared for slower connection speeds. The platform doesn't perform as well in Vietnam.
- **Inaccessible Websites**: Certain websites are blocked in Vietnam, including:
  - **Medium**
  - Some porn websites
- **Tip**: If you rely on any of these platforms, consider downloading content beforehand or using a VPN to access them during your stay.

## Visa Process for Chinese Citizens

- **E-Visa Conversion**: Travelers from China holding an E-Visa need to convert it into a paper visa upon arrival.
  - **Bring Two Photos**: Ensure you have two passport-sized photos ready for the visa conversion process.
  - **Carry Cash for Tips**: It's customary to offer tips during the visa processing, so have some cash (preferably small denominations) on hand.

## Exploring Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City)

- **City Vibes**: Saigon reminded me of a blend between **Shanghai** and **Qingdao**.
  - **Cleanliness**: While the city is bustling with energy, it's not as clean as Shanghai or Qingdao.
- **Abundance of Coffee Shops**: Vietnam is famous for its coffee culture. You'll find numerous coffee shops on almost every street corner.
  - **Must-Try**: Don't miss out on traditional Vietnamese iced coffee (**Cà Phê Sữa Đá**).

## Affordability

- **Cheaper Than Bangkok**: Compared to cities like Bangkok, Saigon is significantly more affordable.
  - **Hotels**: Accommodation can be about **half the price** of equivalent hotels in Bangkok.
  - **General Expenses**: Food, transportation, and entertainment are also reasonably priced.

## Currency and Payments

- **Accepted Currencies**:
  - **Vietnamese Dong (VND)** is the official currency.
  - **US Dollars (USD)** are widely accepted and sometimes preferred.
  - **Chinese RMB** can be used in some places, but USD is more commonly accepted.
- **Tip**: Carrying USD can be convenient, but always have some local currency for small purchases.

## Local Customs and Observations

- **Clothing Choices**: You'll notice many locals wearing long-sleeved clothing and pants, even in hot weather.
  - **Reason**: This is to **prevent sunburn** and protect their skin from the sun.
- **Hardworking People**: The Vietnamese are known for their strong work ethic. Streets are lively with activity from early morning until late at night.
- **Affordable Goods**: Many items, from street food to souvenirs, are priced affordably.
- **Non-Spicy Cuisine**:
  - **Similar to Cantonese Food**: The flavors are mild and focus on the freshness of ingredients.
  - **Must-Try Dishes**: Pho (noodle soup), Banh Mi (baguette sandwich), and fresh spring rolls.

## Final Thoughts

Vietnam offers a captivating blend of cultural experiences, historical sites, and modern attractions. Whether you're sipping coffee in a cozy café, exploring bustling markets, or simply taking in the sights and sounds of the city, there's something for every traveler.

**Travel Tips**:

- **Plan Ahead**: Be aware of the internet limitations and plan accordingly if you need access to certain websites.
- **Stay Hydrated**: The climate can be hot and humid, so drink plenty of water.
- **Respect Local Customs**: Dress modestly when visiting temples or rural areas.

I hope these insights help you in planning your trip to Vietnam. It's a destination filled with unforgettable experiences!
